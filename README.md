Machine Learning in Robotics
Abdulazak Mahfouz, Lav Vrcelj, Nikita Marfitsyn, Arman Khalifeh Soltani, and Noah Tuil
Description
The project is mostly theoretical. We will dig deeper into robots such as Roomba, and understand how they view the world and make decisions on their own. We will demonstrate their mapping methods using a Pacman-like maze and showcase the process of machine learning. A maze will be made where a “robot” has learned to navigate it.



Task Division
Abdulazak - implementation of the maze
Arman  - implementation of the maze
Noah - Reinforcement Learning: Explains the "brain" of the vacuum—how it learns and makes decisions.
Nikita - Human-Centric Design: Explains the "heart" of the vacuum—how it interacts with users and addresses ethical concerns.
Lav - Perception and Mapping: Explains the "eyes" of the vacuum—how it sees and understands the environment.



Demonstration
We will implement a version of the maze with the desired libraries. 
We are going to use the Q-Learnig algorithm for the implementation.
